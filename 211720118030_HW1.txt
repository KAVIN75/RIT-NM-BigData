                                               LINUX AND INTRODUCTION TO BIG DATA HADOOP

                                                                       HOMEWORK 1

      :set number  -it is used to set specific line of the line inside the file. 
      :150 d   -to delete line 150
      :wq    -This command is used to exit and save from a file.



Q2. Write a shell script to add two numbers?

   a=10
   b=20 
   add=$(( $a + $b ))
   echo "Sum is: $add"       #Sum is:30

   

Q3. User root wants to copy /etc, including all subdirectories and files to /tmp.
How will you achieve this task?

    Using the below command can we achieve copy /etc, including all subdirectories and files to /tmp, 
       sudo cd /etc
       cp -r /etc tmp



Q4.Create a file that contains only the username and the user id of all the user present on the server.

    $cat /etc/passwd 
          By this unix command can we create a file that contains only the username and the user id of all the user present on the server.  


Q5.How will you provide a count of all users on the system except for adm user?

    $ who
          Using the above command we can count a  all users on the system except for adm user.



Q6.How will you list all files in /tmp in increasing order of their size?

       > "$ ls -laShr" - Using this command we can list the files in increasing order.
    
       > To list all files and sort them by size we can use the -S.

       > -l flag means long listing and -a tells ls to list all the files.

       > human-readable format by adding the -h

       >add the -r flag is to sort in reverse order



Q7.What command is used to clear history on the Linux server?

     > To delete a particular content, we can use history -d <line number> .

     > To clear the entire history, use history -c .



Q8.Explain Big Data and what are five V’s of Big Data.

Big Data:
       Big data is defined as the data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. It is a tool created to identify patterns on the information in order to design smart solutions

Five V’s of Big Data:
      > velocity
      > volume
      > value
      > variety
      > veracity 



Q9. What is Hadoop and its components?
Hadoop:
      Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large data sets ranging at size from GB(gigabytes) to PB(petabytes).
                
Components of the Hadoop:
     1) Hadoop HDFS 
     2)Hadoop MapReduce
     3)Hadoop YARN
